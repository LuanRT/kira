      Why "Kira"?: Some of the code here was borrowed from another private project of mine
      named "Lyra." It is a YouTube frontend for Android. The name "Lyra" comes from
      my obsession with astronomy, and Lyra is a constellation. While Kira doesn't have
      any astronomical significance, I wanted to keep the name similar to Lyra.
